# Pomodoro-Timer

"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals."

I find this to be an incredibly efficient way of studying, so I deicded to use it as an idea for a project in java, to practice my java skills a little.
